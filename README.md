# Handwritten-Digits-and-Character-Recognition-
Handwritten Digits and Character Recognition 

In this project describes the application of machine learning algorithms to solving the problem of Handwritten digits and character recognition.  

 The handwritten digits  and character are not always of the same size, width, orientation and justified to margins as they differ from writing of person to person. so the general problem would be while classifying the digits and character. 

 The handwritten digit and character  recognition is the solution to this problem which uses the image of a digit and character and recognizes the digit and character present in the image.

In this project we use MNIST(Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) data . The project is based on Handwriting digits and character recognition having 70000 images in different handwriting for the number 0 to 9.  

An extended dataset similar to MNIST called EMNIST has been published in 2017, In our project we have used approximately 63000 images for training and 8000 for testing in character recognition(A-Z).

The MNIST dataset has 10 different classes. The handwritten digits  and character images are represented as a 28×28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.


The steps to implement the handwritten digit  and character recognition
1) Import the libraries and load the dataset
2) Preprocess the data
3) Create the model
4) Train the model
5) Evaluate the model
6) Ensemble technique
7) Create GUI to predict digits
